# Task 1: Modals in the Gutenberg Corpus

# - Task 1.1: Install NLTK
# What this code is doing: Importing the NLTK library to allow the download of the gutenberg texts
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import gutenberg

# - Task 1.2: Download the Gutenberg Corpus
# What this code is doing: Downloading the gutenberg texts and splitter. Storing all texts to a variable to print what they are
nltk.download('gutenberg')
nltk.download('punkt')

files = gutenberg.fileids()
#print(files)
# Files is an array

# - Task 1.3: Define Each Modal Group
# What this code is doing: Creating a list of modal verbs I wnat to look for within the texts (note they are all lowercase)
list_of_modals = ['can', 'could', 'may', 'might', 'will', 'would', 'should']

# - Task 1.4: Count Relative Frequencies of Each Modal Verb
# What this code is doing: 
# Creating an empty dictionary. This dictonary will be filled with the text file as the key and a dictionary of modal counts as the value
# This information is generated by the for loop that loops through each file and converts its contents to an array of arrays
# Creates another empty dictionary to store the modal as the key and the count of the modal in the text as the value.
# The dictionary of modal:count is stored as the value to frequency_of_modals_by_file
frequency_of_modals_by_file = {
# KEY  : VALUE
# FILE : {modal: count}

}
from tabulate import tabulate

for file in files:
    file_words = gutenberg.words(file)
    lowercase_file_words = []
    for word in file_words:
        lowercase_file_words.append(word.lower())
    count_of_each_modal_in_file = {
        # KEY   :  VALUE
        # modal : count of modal
    }
    for modal in list_of_modals:
        count_of_each_modal_in_file[modal] = lowercase_file_words.count(modal)

frequency_table = [(modal, count) for modal, count in frequency_of_modals_by_file.items()]
print(tabulate(frequency_table, headers=["Modal", "Count"], tablefmt="grid"))


# - Task 1.5: Find the Texts with the Largest Span of Modal Frequencies
# What this code is doing: 
# Creating an empty dictionary to store modal_span_information. That information will be the most_frequent_file, least_frequent__file, most_frequent_file_count, and least_frequent_file_count

modal_span_information = {
    # KEY   : VALUE

            modal_span_information[modal]["least_frequent_file"] = file

#print(modal_span_information)

# - Task 1.6: Compare Usage of Modals in the Two Texts
# What this code is doing: This code is looping through each key:value in the modal_span_information to print each of the modals. 
# It is then getting the file names of where the modal appears the most and least and then prints the results

# Explaination of Why the Modal Counts are Different Between Two Texts:
# Setting aside that the books are different, as this is not a good enough explaination of why texts are different across books, its better to look at the time and tone of the texts.
# Formality: Some texts may be more formal than others so woulds like 'may' and 'shall' would appear more. The author may be indicating obligation or necessity.
# Type of Storytelling: The story could be a narrative or a descriptive text in which hypothetical and conditional modals are used more. These tend to explore potential outcomes of character choices.
# Audience: Depending on who the text is written for could could determine how casual modals are used like 'may' and 'could' that fit a more conversational tone.
# Technicality: If the text is in the form of a techincal document, it may focus on precision and clarity with modals like "must"
